  abstract = {Financialization can be characterized as capital switching from the primary, secondary or tertiary circuit to the quaternary circuit of capital. Housing is a central aspect of financialization. The financialization of mortgage markets demands that not just homes but also homeowners become viewed as financially exploitable. It is exemplified by the securitization of mortgage loans, but also by the use of credit scoring and risk-based pricing. In the past century, mortgage markets were transformed from being a ?facilitating market? for homeowners in need of credit to one increasingly facilitating global investment. Since mortgage markets are both local consumer markets and global investment markets, the dynamics of financialization and globalization directly relate homeowners to global investors thereby increasing the volatility in mortgage markets, as the current crisis shows all too well.}

The historical evidence suggests that foreign exchange traders can generate high profits but that any trading strategy also involves substantial risk.

It also explores asymmetric exchange rate responses to diverse monetary policy stances from a new dimension by explicitly measuring asymmetries and capturing long- and short-run dynamics using the new non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) and asymmetric component AC-GARCH models along with other recent methods for results' robustness. Results from alternative methods show that UIP fails to hold in the African members and non-member of OPEC which is attributable to capital mobility restrictions and currency risk. However, asymmetric and permanent/transitory exchange rate response to monetary policy stances was noticed with little evidence of risk premium dynamics and role of price level instability in UIP validity.},

One would indeed expect that the differential of interest rates between two countries should be offset by an opposite evolution of the exchange rate between them, hence ruling out any limited risk profit opportunities. However, it has been shown empirically that this relation is not holding and accordingly has led, over the past two decades, to the reinforcement of a well-known trading strategy in financial markets, namely the currency carry trade. This paper investigates how highly leveraged, mass speculator behaviour affects the dependence structure of currency returns. We propose a rigorous statistical modelling approach using two complementary techniques in order to demonstrate that speculative carry trade volumes are informative in both the covariance and tail dependence of high and low interest rate currency returns, whereas the price based factors previously suggested in the literature hold little explanatory power. We add a new feature to the understanding of the link between the UIP condition and the carry trade strategy, specifically attributed to the large joint exchange rate movements in high and low risk environments.},

This paper considers which (or which combination of) structural shocks can be consistent with the implications of such an interest rate differential shock that has been identified in previous studies. It is especially demand and confidence shocks, rather than supply or monetary policy shocks, which are found to generate effects similar to those produced by an unexpected widening of the interest rate differential and overall lead to longer-term gains from carry trade activity. Also provided is a measure of the potential gain/losses experienced by the actual positioning of market participants in the foreign exchange futures and conditional on the knowledge of the macroeconomic shock that occurred at the time of positioning.},

They deliver novel quantitative benchmarks that reconcile a zero cross-currency basis with non-zero cross-currency basis swap rates.

Predictability is further supported through out-of-sample metrics, and a predictability-based decision rule produces sizable improvements in the Sharpe ratios and skewness profile of carry trade payoffs. Our evidence also indicates that predictability can be traced to the long legs of the carry trades and their currency components.

While most of these implied profit opportunities are relatively small, there is also evidence of some very large deviations from covered interest parity in the sample. In order to examine the persistence of these deviations, we estimated a threshold autoregression in which the dynamics behavior of deviations from covered interest parity is different outside the transaction costs band than inside them. We find that while the impulse response functions when inside the transaction costs band are nearly symmetric, those for the outside the bands are asymmetric-suggesting less persistence outside of the transaction costs band than inside the band.},

Partly reflecting the degree of financial market integration and development, as well as the effects of regulation, carry trades in the region have typically been implemented by taking long forward positions in foreign exchange derivatives markets (offshore or onshore), or in some cases through the acquisition of domestic debt securities in destination currencies. Carry trades have traditionally been implemented at short investment horizons by highly leveraged investors such as hedge funds. However, interviews with market participants have indicated that currency carry trade strategies and investor composition have changed significantly in Latin America since the global financial crisis due to the reduced attractiveness of carry trade investments, shortage of financing for risky, highly leveraged investments like carry trades, and the effects of regulation. Partly as a result, in recent years real money investors who rely less on leverage and who have longer investment horizons have reportedly played a larger role in cross-border portfolio investment, while the relative importance of hedge funds has been declining.}

  abstract = {A standard empirical finding is that expected changes in exchange rates and interest rate differentials across countries are negatively related, implying that uncovered interest rate parity is violated in the data. This article provides new empirical evidence that suggests that violations of uncovered interest rate parity, and its economic implications, depend on the sign of the interest rate differential. A framework related to term structure models is developed to account for the puzzling relationship between expected changes in exchange rates and interest rate differentials. Estimation results suggest that a particular term structure model can account for the puzzling empirical evidence.}

There is no evidence of corporate speculation with derivatives for firms in individual countries or for different types of derivatives, except for marginally higher net commodity price exposure of firms using commodity price derivatives. Firms use derivatives for hedging purposes independent of access to derivatives or country-level corporate governance. While there are no differences in risk between firms in countries with strong and weak shareholder rights, the reduction in risk is larger for firms in countries where creditor rights are weak or where derivatives are readily available. Consequently, policy makers could facilitate corporate hedging activities by pursuing strategies that encourage the development of local-currency derivatives markets. Given the similarity in the use and effect of derivatives across countries, internationally harmonized regulation of derivatives markets may be adequate.},

We apply a novel data-based identification approach of the structural shocks that allows to account for the complex interrelations within the triad of exchange rates, sovereign risks and interest rates. The direction and size of the response of sovereign risk to FX rate movements depend on the considered type of exchange rate measure and on the size of the net foreign currency exposure of an economy. A depreciation of the domestic currency against the USD increases sovereign risk. In contrast, when looking at the nominal effective exchange rate that is unrelated to changes of USD exchange rate, we find in general no significant effect. We conclude that the ‘financial channel’is more important in the transmission of exchange rate shocks to sovereign risk in comparison with the traditional ‘net trade channel’. Moreover, we confirm the prime role of the currency mismatch of the non-public sector for the strength of the ‘financial channel’.},

A purely hypothetical model is then built by assembling various hypotheses derived from the observation of current American trends. The imposition of financial norms, such as shareholder value, requires a new and coherent architecture for the mode of governance of firms, the form of competition, the wage labour nexus and the objectives of monetary policy, public budget and tax system. According to the model, any requirement for increased profit has a variable macro-economic impact on wages and economic activity according to the size of accelerator effects and the relative importance of wage and profit in income formation. The stability of an equity-based regime depends on monetary policy which controls financial bubbles and thus the diffusion of finance may push the economy into a zone of structural instability. The next major financial crisis may originate in the USA whose economy approximates most closely to the model. But, the so-called American 'new economy' combines diverse but interdependent structural transformations: diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies, search for new rules for competition, increased flexibility in wages and employment, shift from manufacturing to services. Finance is an element in, but not the whole of, this complex emerging regime.},

To explain when and how finance wins, the literature emphasizes lobbying capacity (instrumental power) and the financial sector’s central position in the economy (structural power). Increasingly, however, finance also enjoys infrastructural power, which stems from entanglements between specific financial markets and public-sector actors, such as treasuries and central banks, which govern by transacting in those markets. To demonstrate the analytical value of this perspective, the article traces how the European Central Bank (ECB), motivated by monetary policy considerations, has shaped post-crisis financial policymaking in the EU. It shows that the ECB has played a key part in fending off a financial transaction tax on repos and in shoring up and rebuilding the securitization market. With market-based forms of state agency on the rise, infrastructural entanglement and power shed new light on the politics of finance.},

  abstract = {We quantify spillbacks from US monetary policy based on structural scenario analysis and minimum relative entropy methods applied in a Bayesian proxy structural vector-autoregressive model for the time period from 1990 to 2019. We find that spillbacks account for up to half of the overall slowdown in domestic real activity in response to a contractionary US monetary policy shock. Moreover, spillbacks materialise as stock market wealth effects impinge on US consumption, and as Tobin’s q effects impinge on US investment. In particular, a contractionary US monetary policy shock depresses global equity prices, weighing on the value of US households’ portfolios; and it depresses earnings of US firms through declines in foreign sales inducing them to cut back investment. Net trade does not contribute to spillbacks because US monetary policy shocks affect exports and imports similarly. Finally, spillbacks materialise through advanced rather than through emerging market economies, consistent with their relative importance in US foreign equity holdings and US firms’ foreign demand.},

Its novelty is in claiming that, as we have a value and a market price for each good or service, we also have a value and a market price for foreign money. The value is the cost plus reasonable profit corresponding to the exchange rate that makes competitive the country’s competent business enterprises; the nominal exchange rates floats around the value according to the demand and supply of foreign money. This basic distinction of the exchange rate in terms of value and in terms of price allows us to understand that the two equilibriums are defined in value terms, and opens room for a clear distinction of the policies that affect the value from the ones that affect the market price of the exchange rate.

Its aim is to maintain high real interest rates so as to gain from the resulting financialization process, fueled by interest revenues (ii) the existence of a “two-way“ public debt contagion effect between the banking reserves market and the public securities market; and (iii) the use of a high interest rate to finance current account deficits.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}John Maynard Keynes interpreted economic history as a conflict between productive and unproductive capitalism. He identified unproductive capitalism with rentier behavior. Although Keynes is mainly known for his analysis of national capitalist rentiers, he also analyzed rentier behavior at the international level, equating it with creditor nation actions to hoard precious metals, a reserve currency or surplus balances. In this sense, international rentiers acted much like domestic rentiers, placing a brake on expenditure, the expansion of demand, full employment at the global level, and, in general, on economic progress. International rentier behavior not only applies to nations but can also characterize the actions and strategies of agents, such as the financial sector, which has experienced a process of significant growth and transformation as a result of deregulation and liberalization. The expansion of global financial assets was driven in the 1990s and up to the Global Financial Crisis (2008–2009) by global banks and the emergence of large complex financial institutions. A part of banks’ strategy to increase profitability centered on expanding their trading in assets including in foreign exchange, equities and commodities. Global banks have played an important role in commodity markets by their dealings in over-the-counter derivatives markets by lending to commodity dealers and also by having an active presence in the physical hoarding of commodities. This trading strategy contributed, to a large extent, to the transformation of commodities into financial assets and in raising their price during the so-called commodity boom (2002–2011) and thereafter.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Our results do not support the claim that an unconventional monetary loosening acts as a “reverse Robin Hood”. Larger benefits accrue to households at the bottom of the income scale, as the effects via the stimulus to economic activity and employment outweigh those via financial markets. The response of net wealth is moderately U-shaped: less wealthy households take advantage of their leveraged positions, wealthier households of their larger share of financial assets. Overall, the effects on inequality are negligible. The results also suggest that savers are not hurt, as the decrease in the remuneration of assets is compensated by support to labour income and by capital gains.},

We show how interest rates of different maturities of these countries interact.

The main contribution of this article is the use of these spillover indices for stock markets developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009, 2012) for the relation between term structures of different countries. The results show a high degree of spillover in the level (22.79\%), slope (25.53\%), and curvature (15.18\%) factors, with high oscillation of transmission intensities over time. There is a substantial increase in the spillover index during financial crises and other high-volatility periods. The results are important because they show the existence and intensity of international monetary spillovers, serving as a framework for the calibration of models used in monetary policy, as they are sensitive to international shocks. Moreover, changes in the interest rate levels may have impact on sectors that are sensitive to long-term rates and global bond markets.},

The decomposition of market variance into average variance and average correlation shows that the predictive power of market variance is primarily due to average variance since average correlation is not significantly related to carry trade returns.

Changes in a number of risk- and policy-related factors have a significant association with the evolution of CIP deviations. Key measures of FX market liquidity and intermediaries' risk-taking capacity are strongly correlated with the cross-currency basis (the deviation from CIP), and the close relationship between broad U.S. dollar strength and the basis is driven mainly by a common factor depending on other safe-haven currencies' comovements. Post-crisis monetary policies also play a role, as demonstrated by the relationship between CIP deviations, central bank balance sheets, and term premia. Risk-related factors have more explanatory power than monetary policy-related factors over the entire 2010–2018 period, but they are approximately equally influential over the period's second half. Further highlighting the role of bank regulation, we offer evidence that the year-end dynamics of the three-month dollar basis depend on financial regulations targeting global systemically important financial institutions.},

Using high-frequency Treasury futures data to identify U.S. monetary policy shocks, we find, through the lens of an affine term structure model, that these shocks represent revisions to both the expected path of short-term interest rates and required risk compensation. The risk compensation component is especially important during the UMP periods. Further, we find that these high-frequency policy shocks do exhibit sizable effects on U.S. holdings of emerging market assets and their valuations. We also document that the relative effects of U.S. monetary policy shocks are larger for emerging asset returns relative to physical capital flows, and they are largest for emerging equity markets relative to fixed income markets. Last, these effects are largest when the Federal Reserve is engaged in “tapering” its large-scale asset purchase program.},

  abstract = {The impacts of OPEC's political risk on the fluctuations of international crude oil prices have caused widespread concern and analyzing the impacts is of great significance to the investment decisions and risk aversion strategies in the crude oil markets. Therefore, using the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index as a proxy for the countries' political risk situation, we empirically investigate the impacts of OPEC's political risk on the Brent crude oil prices, based on several Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) models. The main empirical results indicate that: (1) The political risk of OPEC countries does have a significant and positive influence on Brent crude oil prices in the sample period from January 1998 to September 2014, and the most significant positive influences appear in about one and a half year and last about a year. (2) OPEC's integrated political risk contributes to 17.58\% of the oil price fluctuations in the sample period, which is only lesser than that of the oil demand shocks (34.64\%). (3) Compared with the political risk of OPEC countries in North Africa and South America, the political risk of OPEC countries in the Middle East contributes most to the oil price fluctuations. (4) Among the eight components of the political risk in OPEC, the internal conflicts contribute most to the oil price fluctuations in the sample period.},

In contrast to previous studies, which have used short-horizon data, we test this hypothesis using interest rates on longer-maturity bonds for the U.S., Germany, Japan and Canada. The results of these long-horizon regressions are much more positive – the coefficients on interest differentials are of the correct sign, and most are closer to the predicted value of unity than to zero. These results are robust to the use of different data frequencies, sample periods, yield definitions, and base currencies. We appeal to an econometric interpretation of the results, which focuses on the presence of simultaneity in a cointegration framework.},

We star by analyzing specificities of the Brazilian data and the variables used to estimate the parity. We argue that the relevantforeign interest ratevariable to test the CIP in Brazil is that oneavailable to domestic agents, whose proxy is the LIBOR rate plus the Brazilian EMBI+ (the spread between the Brazilian sovereigndebt and the US treasury bonds rate). We then compare this rate with the Brazilian foreign exchange coupon (which is a tautological closure to the covered parity) as an alternative way to evaluate the CIP.

Para tanto,são exploradas as peculiaridades dos dados brasileiros e das variáveis utilizadas na estimação. Argumenta-se que a taxa de juros externa relevante para o teste da CIP no Brasil é aquela acessível aos agentes internos, cuja proxy é a taxa libor acrescida do EMBI+ brasileiro (o spread entre os títulos da dívida externa soberana brasileira e a taxa livre de risco americana). Por fim, a comparação desta taxa com a do cupom cambial - que constitui um fechamento tautológico para a paridade coberta - estabelece um método alternativo para validar a CIP,o qual corrobora os resultados dos testes diretos.},

We show that this reflects the performance of inflation targeting regimes in lowering the level and volatility of inflation. Our finding holds when controlling for country-specific effects, time-specific effects, global disinflation, exchange rate management, crises, and using different econometric techniques.},

Our findings point towards pronounced changes in the international transmission of US monetary policy throughout the sample period, especially so for the reaction of international output, equity prices and exchange rates against the US dollar. In general, the strength of spillovers has weakened in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Using simple panel regressions, we link the variation in international responses to measures of trade and financial globalization. We find that a broad trade base and a high degree of financial integration with the world economy tend to cushion risks stemming from a foreign shock such as US tightening of monetary policy, whereas a reduction in trade barriers and/or a liberalization of the capital account increase these risks.},

  abstract = {Portfolio rebalancing is a key driver of the Uncovered Equity Parity (UEP) condition. According to UEP, when foreign equity holdings outperform domestic holdings, domestic investors are exposed to higher exchange rate exposure and hence repatriate some of the foreign equity to decrease their exchange rate risk. By doing so, foreign currency is sold, leading to foreign currency depreciation. We examine the relationship between U.S. investors' portfolio reallocations and returns and find some evidence consistent with UEP: Portfolio shifts are related to past returns in the underlying equity markets. But we argue that a motive other than reducing currency risk exposure is likely behind this rebalancing. In particular, U.S. investors rebalance away from equity markets that recently performed well and move into equity markets just prior to relatively strong performance, suggesting tactical reallocations to increase returns rather than reduce risk.},

The empirical analysis is implemented for the USA, where the dynamics in income inequality is mainly driven by the variation in the top one percent of the income distribution. The paper uses the inequality measures that represent the whole income distribution. The distributive effect of monetary policy is evaluated in the cases of different frequency data. To identify a monetary policy shock, the paper applies the contemporaneous and the long run identification methods. In particular, a cointegration relation is determined among the considered variables and the vector error correction methodology is used for the identification. The obtained results indicate that contractionary monetary policy decreases income inequality. These results can have important implications for the design of policies to reduce income inequality by giving more weight to monetary policy.},

The global VAR (GVAR) model is estimated for 26 countries, the euro area being treated as a single economy, over the period 1979–2003. It advances research in this area in a number of directions. In particular, it provides a theoretical framework where the GVAR is derived as an approximation to a global unobserved common factor model. Using average pair-wise cross-section error correlations, the GVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with the common factor interdependencies and international co-movements of business cycles. It develops a sieve bootstrap procedure for simulation of the GVAR as a whole, which is then used in testing the structural stability of the parameters, and for establishing bootstrap confidence bounds for the impulse responses. Finally, in addition to generalized impulse responses, the current paper considers the use of the GVAR for ‘structural’ impulse response analysis with focus on external shocks for the euro area economy, particularly in response to shocks to the US.

We base our analysis of an appropriate Keynesian policy mix for these countries on the concept of currency hierarchy, where the currencies of peripheral emerging economies have a lower liquidity premium than the currencies of advanced economies. The international asymmetry related to the currency hierarchy, amplified by financial globalization, imposes major constraints to the adoption of Keynesian policies for these economies. Under these conditions, we argue that domestic economic policy coordination should lay a major focus on a low policy rate and, especially, a competitive exchange rate for obtaining, at least, a balanced current account, in order to prevent capital flows boom-bust-cycles with subsequent financial crises. We conclude that it is a rather ambitious and long-term goal to climb up the currency hierarchy, especially under the current condition of financial globalization.},

Our analyses show that the following causes contributed to the derivatives loss: (1) the CFO reported directly to the Board of the Directors, and not to the CEO, (2) the Board of Directors did not know which areas were responsible for controlling risk in the derivatives transactions, (3) risk control monitoring systems were inefficient, (4) the company was operating as a “bank,” and (5) under BR GAAP, derivatives financial instruments were treated as off-balance sheet items.}

However, during the recent financial crisis, the carry strategy suffered losses of up to 20\% on invested capital. We investigate whether investors could have used the implied option volatility index on the US equity market (the VIX) or the option implied volatility index from G7 currencies (the VXY) to time the currency carry trade. We examine a large set of timing strategies and find that for some specific settings excess returns can be as large as 2.5\% per annum. However, when we take into account that we investigated many trading strategies, these excess returns turn out not to be statistically significant. Hence, our findings cast doubt on implied volatility as a stand-alone timing indicator for currency carry trading in real-life portfolio decisions.},

Capturing both bilateral trade and financial exposures in a GVAR fits the data better than using trade weights only. We use sign restrictions on the short-run impulse responses in the US model to identify the credit supply shocks. We find that negative credit supply shocks have strong negative effects on US and foreign GDP. Credit and equity markets in several countries respond clearly to the shocks. Exchange rate responses are consistent with a “flight to quality” to the US dollar. The credit supply shocks explain about a fifth of one-year-ahead output forecast error variance in the US and about a tenth in the euro area and the UK, but considerably less elsewhere.},

This paper surveys advances in this area since the publication of Hodrick's (1987) survey. It documents that the change in the future exchange rate is generally negatively related to the forward discount. Properties of the expected forward forecast error are reviewed. Issues such as the relation of uncovered interest parity to real interest parity, and the implications of uncovered interest parity for cointegration of various quantities are discussed. The modeling and testing for risk premiums is surveyed. Included in this area are tests of the consumption CAPM, tests of the latent variable model, and portfolio-balance models of risk premiums. General equilibrium models of the risk premium are examined and their empirical implications explored. The survey does not cover the important areas of learning and peso problems, tests of rational expectations based on survey data, or the models of irrational expectations and speculative bubbles.},

  abstract = {We re-examine the time-series evidence for failures of uncovered interest rate parity on short-term deposits for the U.S. dollar versus major currencies of developed countries at short-, medium- and long-horizons. The evidence that interest rate differentials predict foreign exchange risk premiums is fragile. The relationship between interest rates and excess returns is not stable over time and disappears altogether when nominal interest rates are near the zero-lower bound. However, we do find evidence that year-on-year inflation rate differentials consistently predict excess returns – when the U.S. dollar y.o.y. inflation rate has been relatively high, subsequent returns on U.S. deposits tend to be high. We interpret this evidence as being consistent with hypotheses that posit that markets do not fully react initially to predictable changes in future monetary policy. Interestingly, the predictive power of relative y.o.y. inflation only begins in the mid-1980s when central banks began to target inflation more consistently and continues in the post-ZLB period when interest rates lose their primacy as a policy instrument. However, we caution not to rule out the possibility that excess returns are not predictable at all.},

  abstract = {This paper synthesizes recent advances in the theoretical and empirical literature on capital controls. We start by observing that international capital flows have both benefits and costs, but some of these are not internalized by individual actors and thus constitute externalities. The theoretical literature has identified pecuniary externalities and aggregate demand externalities that respectively contribute to financial instability and recessions. These externalities provide a natural rationale for counter-cyclical capital controls that lean against boom and busts cycles in international capital flows. The empirical literature has developed several measures of capital controls to capture different aspects of capital account openness. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different measures and provide an overview of the empirical findings on the effectiveness of capital controls in addressing the externalities identified by the theory literature, i.e. in reducing financial fragility and enhancing macroeconomic stability. We also discuss strategies to deal with the endogeneity of capital controls in such statistical exercises. We conclude by providing an overview of the historical and current debates on the role of capital controls in macroeconomic management and their relationship to the academic literature.}

Our model identifies the weekly carry trade position in each currency by matching data on forex trading flows with the predictions of a dynamic portfolio allocation problem that exploits the predictability in excess currency returns (deviations from uncovered interest parity). Using these carry positions produce two surprising results: First, in nine countries carry trades are an economically significant driver of interest rate differentials (vs. U.S. rates). Second, the carry trade only affects the dynamics of spot exchange rates insofar as it is contributes to total forex order flow; (i.e., flows generated by the carry trade and all other trading motives). These findings contradict the conventional view that sudden large movements in exchange rates are attributable to the carry trade. They suggest, instead, that the effects of the global carry trade are primarily concentrated in bond markets.},

The paper argues that the dominant view on the international position of the dollar has been based on a Metallist view of money. In the alternative Cartalist view of money, the hegemon is not required to maintain credible macroeconomic policies (i.e., fiscally contractionary policies to maintain the value of the currency), but to provide an asset free of the risk of default. Further, it is argued that the current crisis in Europe shows why the euro is not a real contender for hegemony in the near future.},

The model captures daily dynamics well, explaining approximately 73\% of the variation in USDCHF and 37\% of the variation in EURCHF, reflecting the importance of global factors for Swiss franc exchanges rates. The risk factor contributes the most to Swiss franc dynamics, especially in times of a worsening risk environment, highlighting the role of the Swiss franc as a safe-haven currency. Global factors had been almost completely reflected in USDCHF dynamics before the euro area debt crisis, but once that crisis began, they also became important for EURCHF. In a case study of the introduction of the EURCHF minimum exchange rate we showcase the importance of momentum in daily Swiss franc returns.},

Even the IMF (International Monetary Fund), long a stalwart proponent of financial liberalization, has engaged in a new debate on capital flow management. Drawing lessons from empirical case studies on Brazil and South Korea, this paper finds that the new IMF framework remains insufficient in two main aspects. First, by defining ‘capital flow management measures’ (CFMs) as a temporary instrument embedded in an overall strategy of financial opening, the organization insists on the general advantages of financial liberalization, which poses serious limits to emerging economies’ policy space. Second, the Fund keeps on stressing a separation of prudential financial regulation, which should be permanent, and temporary CFMs. Yet, the case studies presented here show that, especially for emerging markets with rather open and sophisticated domestic financial markets, both types of measures are interdependent and overlapping. Additionally, we demonstrate the relevance of a third type of regulation, lying on foreign exchange (FX) derivatives instruments, which may also be required to effectively manage foreign investors’ portfolio reallocations and their impact.},

Three distinct periods in the timeline of crisis show that central bank interventions were crucial in resuscitating financialization and that attempts to re-embed finance cannot be successful if public debt dynamics are neglected.},

The UN's Billions to Trillions agenda, the World Bank's Maximizing Finance for Development or the G20's Infrastructure as an Asset Class update the Washington Consensus for the age of the portfolio glut, to ‘escort’ global (North) institutional investors and the managers of their trillions into development asset classes. Making development investible requires a two-pronged strategy: enlist the state into risk-proofing development assets and accelerate the structural transformation of local financial systems towards market-based finance that better accommodates portfolio investors. Ten policy commandments forge the ‘de-risking state’. They create a safety net for investors in development assets, protecting their profits from demand risks attached to commodified infrastructure assets; from political risks attached to (progressive) policies that would threaten cash flows, including nationalization, higher minimum wages and, critically, climate regulation; and from liquidity and currency risks. These risks are transferred to the balance sheet of the state. The new ‘development as de-risking’ paradigm narrows the scope for a green developmental state that could design a just transition to low-carbon economies.},

The main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. This procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. In this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. The computational burden is then alleviated by using the Gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. Those subsets with higher probability—the promising ones—can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the Gibbs sample.},

The results suggest that the transmission of monetary policy across euro area economies displays asymmetries, and that, in line with economic theory, these are driven by differences in economies׳ structural characteristics. In particular, euro area economies in which a higher share of aggregate output is accounted for by sectors servicing interest rate sensitive demand exhibit a stronger transmission of monetary policy to real activity. Similarly, even though the evidence is less conclusive, euro area economies which feature more real wage and/or fewer unemployment rigidities also appear to display a stronger transmission of monetary policy to real activity.},

The concerns that have been raised recently about the compensation thesis are also discussed. The cambist view~– so-called because the view originates from the dealers themselves~– on the determination of the forward exchange rate is then presented, and an assessment of relatively recent apparent deviations from the covered interest parity condition is then being offered. The main inference of the chapter is that post-Keynesians ought to integrate the compensation thesis and the cambist view in their work on international finance.}

A seasonal profit (carry trade) opportunity can be created by the simultaneous appreciation of a country’s currency and the outperformance of its stock market. By focusing on the world’s key currency pairs, the US dollar-Deutsche mark and the US dollar-euro, and by using a Markov-switching framework, we document persistent January and December effects in the foreign exchange market from 1971 to 2017. Analysis of the German-US stock returns differential and their bilateral capital flows reveal similar month effects in 65\% of the whole sample.},

From the previous literature, it is less clear however what the most important drivers for the cyclical REER movements in EME are. The main aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence about the determinants of the REER movements of 15 emerging markets during the last two decades, using statistical analysis and a dynamic panel fixed effects model approach. Our analysis shows that although \&quot;commodity\&quot; and \&quot;industrial\&quot; EME are heterogeneous, REER volatility tends to be higher among the former. Yet, REER volatility between emerging and advanced countries does not differ very much, apart from a few EME countries. Countries that had more stable REER trend fared better than those that had a depreciating or appreciating trend (with the notable exception of China). As theoretically expected, commodity prices are an important structural driver of REER movements in \&quot;commodity EME\&quot;. Moreover, the results confirm the existence of the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson effect, and show the importance of financial inflows. Further, exchange rate regimes and the intervention of central banks were partially successful to avoid more substantial appreciations (depreciations). Finally, we find that lower country risk and, at least in some periods, growing broad money has led to REER appreciations.},

The paper also explores tensions around rebranding as exemplified by efforts to develop a hierarchy in which controls on inflows that are a last resort and are targeted, temporary, and non-discriminatory are more acceptable than those that are blunt, enduring, discriminatory, and that target outflows. In addition, tensions have increasingly emerged over whether controls should be used by capital-source rather than just capital-recipient countries.}

A “safe haven” currency is a currency that offers hedging value against global risk, both on average and in particular in crisis episodes. To explore these issues we estimate the relationship between exchange rate returns and risk factors in augmented UIP regressions, using recently developed econometric methods to account for the possibility that the regression coefficients may be changing over time. Our results highlight that in response to increases in global risk the Swiss franc appreciates against typical carry trade investment currencies such as the Australian dollar, but depreciates against the US dollar, the Yen and the British pound. Thus, the Swiss franc exhibits safehaven characteristics against many, but not all other currencies. We find statistically significant time variation in the relationship between Swiss franc returns and risk factors, with this link becoming stronger in times of stress.},

  abstract = {In this empirical study, we analyze the relationship between carry trade positions and some key financial as well as macroeconomic variables using a multivariate threshold model. It is often stated that the Swiss franc serves as a funding currency. We therefore focus on carry trades based on the USD/CHF and EUR/CHF currency pairs over the period from 1995 to mid-2008. We conclude that carry trades are driven to a large extent by changes in investors' risk sentiment, movements in stock market prices and exchange rate fluctuations. The adjustments of carry trade positions to unexpected movements in these variables vary between periods of high and low interest-rate differentials (IRD). While a positive shock to the IRD is followed by a rise in carry trade positions during a period of low IRD, it will trigger a decline in these positions during a period of high IRD. These results suggest that the shock to the IRD itself is not enough to compensate investors for the increased foreign exchange risk. Moreover, a positive stock market price shock is associated with a rise in carry trade positions, since investors may use stock portfolios as collateral for liquidity. A sudden unwinding of carry trades leads to significant Swiss franc appreciation. Furthermore, carry trade activities 'Granger-cause' the nominal exchange rate in periods of low IRD. The Granger causality test results further indicate feedback trading.},

First, in a VAR framework, the effects of both types of monetary policy on income distribution are evaluated. Second, the marginal effect of income dispersion on the consumption elasticity to monetary shocks is investigated using the same framework. The results suggest high cross-country heterogeneity in the impact of monetary policy and non-linearities associated with the redistributive strength of fiscal policy and the maturity of the household portfolio. Standard expansionary monetary measures typically have a small contractionary effect on income distribution. Mildly high-income dispersion is beneficial for the transmission of the monetary shocks to consumption because it overcomes the negative effect of consumption smoothing. However, for what concerns Q.E. measures, poorly redistributive fiscal policy and highly sensitive households’ portfolio might trigger these results.},

We find that only a few factors are robustly associated to a safe haven status, most notably the net foreign asset position, an indicator of external vulnerability, and whether currencies have been a good hedge in the past. In addition, the currencies of large, less financially open economies are a good hedge against global risk aversion shocks. By contrast, the level of the interest rate spread vs. the US is significant only during the latest crisis. Finally, we find some evidence of non-linearity as the importance of the fundamentals is stronger during crisis times.},

A new computationally tractable econometric methodology for examining restrictions on a k-step-ahead forecasting equation is employed. Using data sampled more finely than the forecast interval, we are able to reject the simple market efficiency hypothesis for exchange rates from the 1970s and the 1920s. For the modern experience, the tests are also inconsistent with several alternative hypotheses which typically characterize the relationship between spot and forward exchange rates.}

Studies have focused on the role of risk, but thus far no one has been able to put forward a source thereof that can account for the specific pattern of deviations from UIRP. This paper offers an alternative perspective that finally resolves the mystery. Drawing on the work of Marc Lavoie and John Smithin and extending it with some basic Post Keynesian propositions regarding endogenous money, uncertainty, and nonergodicity, it is shown that one can devise a comprehensive explanation of UIRP–an explanation that shows that much more than risk is responsible for deviations. In particular, it is argued that Keynes's "confidence" is a vitally important and overlooked factor. This contention is supported by a regression analysis of the U.S.-German and U.S.- Japanese asset markets.},

Differences in short-term interest rates across currencies help to explain the incidence of the carry trade, as does the measure of implied equity risk given by the VIX index. The conjunction of deteriorating credit conditions in the United States and the weakness of the dollar against the yen in the early stages of the credit crisis of 2007–08 can thus be seen as two sides of the same coin. Both can be seen as consequences of financial sector deleveraging in the United States.},

More recently, various tech writers, bloggers, and consultants have begun proposing gamification as a solution also in financial services, where gamification has already made headway, for instance, with day trading apps that simplify trading and turn it into a real-time game. In this paper, we examine the emerging discourse of finance gamification and situate it in the expectational dynamics and performative struggles that shape technological developments in finance and the FinTech industry. We argue that the discourse creates positional uncertainty among finance incumbents by linking the notion of a generational wealth transfer to narratives about generational change. Tech writers, consultants and journalists neutralize this uncertainty by propagating a model of human nature, which may be ‘tapped into’ and harnessed with games to rationalize subjects’ financial behavior. However, despite finance gamification’s promises to democratize finance and empower small-time investors by extending access to financial markets, we argue that, in the end, the discourse on finance gamification reinforces the ‘observational boundaries’ between finance and society.},

Indeed, the functionality of the financial system is not a detail that can boost the results of each round of economic development, but a fundamental condition for development in the long run. The lack of a private financial structure to support economic development is an old and well-known limitation of the Brazilian financial system. Finally, the recent growth of the financial system in Brazil, in terms of both capital markets and credit markets, shows that the development of long-term financial relationships in Brazil has a long way to go.},

  abstract = {We analyze which currencies can be regarded as safe haven currencies. Our empirical approach allows us to distinguish between a low- and high-stress regime, and to control for the impact of carry trade reversals and other fundamental determinants. We therefore address the question of whether a supposed safe haven currency only appreciates in times of crises because carry trades are unwound, in which the corresponding currency has served as funding currency, or whether it possesses “true” safe haven qualities; i.e. it provides a hedge in stressful times even after controlling for the impact of carry trade reversals. The latter issue has largely been brushed aside in the extant literature but has important policy implications for the justification of central bank FX interventions in times of crises. According to the estimation results, two currencies, the Swiss franc and (to a lesser extent) the US dollar, qualify as safe haven currencies, and the euro serves as a hedge currency. Results for the yen support its role as a carry funding vehicle, but not necessarily that of a safe haven currency. While the focus is on effective exchange rates, the paper also contains a separate analysis of bilateral euro-based exchange rates, given the euro's prominent role during the euro area sovereign debt crisis.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a Bayesian global vector autoregressive model with stochastic volatility. Three variants of the stochastic volatility are implemented in an attempt to improve the existing homoscedastic framework. Our baseline model assumes that the variance–covariance matrix is driven by a set of idiosyncratic, country-specific and regional factors. In contrast, the second specification adopted implies that the error variance of each equation is determined by an independent stochastic process. The final specification assumes that the country-specific volatility follows a single factor, which leads to significant computational gains. Considering a range of competing models, we forecast a large panel of macroeconomic variables and find that the stochastic volatility influences the predictive accuracy in three ways. First, it helps to improve the overall predictive fit of our model. Second, it helps to make the model more resilient to outliers and economic crises. Finally, taking a regional stance reveals that the forecasts in developing economies tend to profit more from the use of the stochastic volatility.},

In this article, we apply the Normal-Gamma shrinkage prior to the VAR with stochastic volatility case and derive its relevant conditional posterior distributions. This framework imposes a set of normally distributed priors on the autoregressive coefficients and the covariance parameters of the VAR along with Gamma priors on a set of local and global prior scaling parameters. In a second step, we modify this prior setup by introducing another layer of shrinkage with scaling parameters that push certain regions of the parameter space to zero. Two simulation exercises show that the proposed framework yields more precise estimates of model parameters and impulse response functions. In addition, a forecasting exercise applied to U.S. data shows that this prior performs well relative to other commonly used specifications in terms of point and density predictions. Finally, performing structural inference suggests that responses to monetary policy shocks appear to be reasonable.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the following paper is to examine, in the light of recent doctrines, the effects of speculation on economic stability. Speculation, for the purposes of this paper, may be defined as the purchase (or sale) of goods with a view to re-sale (re-purchase) at a later date, where the motive behind such action is the expectation of a change in the relevant prices relatively to the ruling price and not a gain accruing through their use, or any kind of transformation effected in them or their transfer between different markets. Thus, while merchants and other dealers do make purchases and sales which might be termed ‘speculative’, their ordinary transactions do not fall within this category. What distinguishes speculative purchases and sales from other kinds of purchases and sales is the expectation of an impending change in the ruling market price as the sole motive of action. Hence ‘speculative stocks’ of anything may be defined as the difference between the amount actually held and the amount that would be held if, other things being the same, the price of that thing were expected to remain unchanged; and they can be either positive or negative.1}

It argues that the recommendation by neoclassical economists and international financial institutions (IFIs) to combine an inflation-targeting regime with exchange rate management, whilst maintaining open capital accounts, is not only impossible but also potentially counterproductive. The article draws on extensive semi-structured interviews with currency traders in Brazil and London to show that this is due to the particular way such a regime shapes central bank interventions in the money and foreign exchange markets and the destabilizing way these interventions interact with financial market expectations. The interview results also demonstrate that the guidelines issued by IFIs actually undermine, rather than aid, DEC central banks’ initial attempts to manage excessive exchange rate movements. These results support the long-standing argument by heterodox economists and critical international political economists that DECs need to make the exchange rate an explicit instrument and goal of their macroeconomic policy and complement it with comprehensive capital account regulations to reduce the destabilizing impact of international capital flows. The interview results also give some concrete suggestions on how to achieve this.},

The results point to important structural changes in Brazil’s financial integration in the form of currency internationalisation and financialisation. Moreover, they show that this internationalisation has been mediated through a structured and hierarchic international monetary system which fundamentally distinguishes exchange rate drivers in emerging economies from those in developed ones.}

It argues that in ECEs these financial transformations, akin to the financialisation phenomena observed in Core Capitalist Economies (CCEs), are fundamentally shaped by their subordinated integration into a financialised and structured world economy. To analyse this subordinated financialisation, the paper draws on the framework of international currency hierarchies. It shows by means of two specific processes how the existence of a hierarchic international monetary system has changed the financial behaviour of domestic economic agents, and with it the structure of the financial system. The first process highlights the phenomenon of reserve accumulation and the changing behaviour of domestic banks. The second points to ECEs’ sustained external vulnerability and its impact on the operations of Brazilian non-financial corporations. The paper also shows that not only were these financial transformations shaped by ECEs’ subordinated financial integration, but also that it was these financialisation tendencies themselves which contributed to cementing existing hierarchies and further deepened existing asymmetries between ECEs and CCEs.},

In the first two sessions, we discuss, respectively, the transmission channels of monetary policy to income distribution and the empirical strategies used to measure it. The majority of surveyed papers find that a contractionary monetary policy worsen the income distribution, and that an expansionist policy tends to improve it. Moreover, several papers found that the higher is the redistributive impact of fiscal policy, the lower is the impact of monetary policy on inequality. Another outcome with empirical support is the role of the labor share on total income: the higher is this share, the higher is the impact of monetary policy on inequality. The last point discussed is the asymmetric effects of contractionary and expansionary monetary policy. There is evidence that increases in interest rates have statistically significant effects on income distribution, whereas the effects of reductions in interest rates are not statistically different from zero. This empirical finding goes against the conventional view that the distributional effects of interest rate changes are temporary and likely to net out over the business cycle.},

There is a rich literature stressing peculiarities of individual country experiences, but little systematic comparison across EMEs. This paper fills this gap, providing an overview of the debate and identifying six financialisation interpretations for EMEs. These different interpretations stress (1) financial deregulation, (2) foreign financial inflows, (3) asset price volatility, (4) the shift from bank-based to market-based finance, (5) business debt, and (6) household indebtedness. We construct and compare measures of the six financialisation interpretations across a sample of 17 EMEs from Latin America, emerging Europe, Africa and Asia, contrasting them with the US and UK, two financialised economies. We find considerable variation in financialisation experiences of EMEs. Asset price volatility is found across the continents. Asia has been more exposed to capital inflows, stock markets have gained importance and private sector debt has risen. In emerging Europe financial deregulation has been more pronounced with lower levels but strong increases in household debt. The picture is similar in South Africa, the African EME in the sample, where household debt is comparatively high. Financialisation in Latin America is weaker according to our measures.},

Therefore, this article provides a structured overview of the emerging literature on financialisation and the state. We define financialisation of the state broadly as the changed relationship between the state, understood as sovereign with duties and accountable towards its citizens, and financial markets and practices, in ways that can diminish those duties and reduce accountability. We then argue that there are four ways in which financialisation works in and through public institutions and policies: adoption of financial logics, advancing financial innovation, embracing financial accumulation strategies and directly financialising the lives of their citizens. Organising our review around the two main policy fields of fiscal and monetary policy, four definitions of financialisation in the context of public policy and institutions emerge. When dealing with public expenditure on social provisions, financialisation most often refers to the transformation of public services into the basis for actively traded financial assets. In the context of public revenue, financialisation describes the process of creating and deepening secondary markets for public debt, with the state turning into a financial market player. Finally, in the realm of monetary policy, financial deregulation is perceived to have paved the way for financialisation, while inflation targeting and the encouragement, or outright pursuit, of market-based short-term liquidity management among financial institutions constitute financialised policies.},

  abstract = {Once the urgent problems of reparations, which had deeply troubled Keynes at the Peace Conference at Versailles, were on their way towards solution, Keynes turned to the equally grave problems of the currencies of Europe and their adjustment to the post-war world. These issues had been discussed in the series of Reconstruction Supplements of the Manchester Guardian Commercial that he had edited during 1922. In the Tract Keynes drew heavily on his own contributions to that series. This edition makes available the variations between the texts. The Tract remains of interest in three respects. First, it shows the state of Keynes's thinking about monetary problems and the causes of inflation in the early 1920s. Second, it provides one of the clearest expositions ever written of the determination of forward exchange rates. Third, it shows Keynes already favouring flexible exchange rates as a means of allowing independence in national economic policy.},

The book traces the evolution of the structural VAR methodology and contrasts it with other common methodologies, including dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. It is intended as a bridge between the often quite technical econometric literature on structural VAR modeling and the needs of empirical researchers. The focus is not on providing the most rigorous theoretical arguments, but on enhancing the reader's understanding of the methods in question and their assumptions. Empirical examples are provided for illustration.},

One data set frequently used in those efforts is a weekly report of net futures market positions held by speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In this article, the authors pursue a transaction-oriented line of research to track short-term exchange rate moves. They examine the data set for six currencies over a ten-year period and document a strong contemporaneous relationship between weekly changes in speculators' net positions and exchange rates. The authors find that knowing what speculators did over a given week gives one a 75 percent probability of correctly guessing an exchange rate's direction over that week. One explanation for this relationship is that these speculators-acting on their interpretation of public and private information-have some success anticipating how underlying demand will move exchange rates from their prevailing levels in the very short term.},

Carry is not explained by known predictors of returns from these asset classes, and it captures many of these predictors, providing a unifying framework for return predictability. We reject a generalized version of Uncovered Interest Parity and the Expectations Hypothesis in favor of models with varying risk premia, in which carry strategies are commonly exposed to global recession, liquidity, and volatility risks, though none fully explains carry’s premium.},

While numerous researchers have noted the increasing salience of finance, there have been few systematic attempts to consider what this shift means for the nature of the economy, considered broadly. In large part, this omission reflects the considerable methodological difficulties associated with using national economic data to assess the rise of finance as a macro-level phenomenon shaping patterns of accumulation in the US economy. The paper develops two discrete measures of financialization and applies these measures to postwar US economic data in order to determine if, and to what extent, the US economy is becoming financialized. The paper concludes by considering some of the implications of financialization for two areas of ongoing debate in the social sciences: (1) the question of who controls the modern corporation; and (2) the controversy surrounding the extent to which globalization has eroded the autonomy of the state.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the debate about the puzzle of the Swiss Interest Rate Island. It starts out by establishing some stylized facts about the nature of the puzzle. First it shows that long run real returns on Swiss Euro Deposits have been significantly lower than in any other major currency. A decomposition of return differentials into deviations from uncovered interest rate parity and deviations from purchasing power parity reveals that the former contributes most to the puzzle. Two implications follow from these stylized facts: (i) since the puzzle is present in Euro Deposit rates it cannot be due to local factors such as banking secrecy, and (ii) solutions to the puzzle have to provide an explanation for a long run failure of uncovered interest rate parity rather than for real appreciation. Historical evidence is presented that suggests the puzzle may be attributed to a reverse peso problem. The paper discusses the consequences of this interpretation for Swiss monetary and exchange rate policy. Diese Arbeit leistet einen Beitrag zu der Debatte über das Rätsel "Zinsinsel Schweiz" indem es stilisierte Fakten über die Natur dieses Rätsels dokumentiert. Als erstes wird aufgezeigt, dass die langfristigen realen Erträge auf Schweizer Euro Einlagen deutlich niedriger waren als in anderen Hauptwährungen. Eine Zerlegung der Ertragsunterschiede in Abweichungen von der ungedeckten Zinsparität und Abweichungen von Kaufkraftparität enthüllt, dass der erste Faktor den Hauptanteil am Rätsel trägt. Zwei Folgerungen ergeben sich daraus: (i) nachdem sich dieses Rätsel in Euro Einlagen zeigt, kann es nicht durch nationale Eigenschaften wie z.B. das Bankgeheimnis verursacht werden, und (ii) Lösungen für dieses Rätsel müssen eine Erklärung für das langfristige Versagen der ungedeckten Zinsparität liefern und nicht für die reale Wertsteigerung.

It finds that the growth in cross-border positions in relation to world GDP has come to a halt. This reflects much weaker capital flows to and from advanced economies, with diminished cross-border banking activity, and an increase in the weight of emerging economies in global GDP, as these economies have lower external assets and liabilities than advanced economies. Cross-border FDI positions have continued to expand, unlike positions in portfolio instruments and other investment. This expansion reflects primarily positions vis-à-vis financial centers, suggesting that the complexity of the corporate structure of large multinational corporations is playing an important role. The paper also explores the cross-country drivers of foreign ownership of domestic debt securities, highlighting in particular the role of the euro debt crisis in explaining its evolution.}

The concerns that have been raised recently about the compensation thesis are also discussed. The cambist view~– so-called because the view originates from the dealers themselves~– on the determination of the forward exchange rate is then presented, and an assessment of relatively recent apparent deviations from the covered interest parity condition is then being offered.

The exchange rates analyzed here include a broad spectrum of countries: developed, developing, low-inflation, and high-inflation countries. Based on the empirical evidence, there does not appear to be a well-publicized UIP puzzle for cross-sectional UIP, and the slope estimates remain largely between zero and one throughout the sample periods, with a few exceptions. Evidence of UIP is more clear for low inflation countries than for high inflation countries. As interest rate maturity becomes longer from one month to 12 months, the UIP relationship becomes weaker.},

The forward-premium regressions yield positive slope estimates over the whole sample. The estimates become negative only when the sample is dominated by the period of 1980s. We also find that large interest-rate differentials have significantly stronger forecasting powers for currency movements than small interest-rate differentials. Furthermore, when we regress domestic currency returns on foreign bonds against returns on domestic bonds as an alternative test of the parity condition, the null hypotheses of zero intercept and unit slope cannot be rejected in most cases. These results are consistent with a world in which expectations formation is highly imperfect and characterized on the one hand by slow adjustment of expectations to actual regime changes and on the other by anticipations for extended periods of regime changes or other big events that never materialize. An historical account of expected and realized regime changes adds credence to this explanation and illustrates how uncovered interest-rate parity holds over the very long haul but nevertheless can be deviated from over long periods of time due to ex post-expectation errors.},

The hypothesis that monetary authorities manage interest rates so as to smooth their movements, while also resisting changes in exchange rates, is attractive conceptually and is capable of explaining not only theĝb = −3 finding but also several other notable features of the data.},

Set identification of the US oil supply shock is achieved through imposing dynamic sign restrictions on the impulse responses of the model. The results show that there are considerable heterogeneities in the responses of different countries to a US supply-driven oil price shock, with real GDP increasing in both advanced and emerging market oil-importing economies, output declining in commodity exporters, inflation falling in most countries, and equity prices rising worldwide. Overall, our results suggest that a US supply-driven oil price shock (equivalent to a 10–12\% fall per quarter in the price of oil) results in an increase in global growth by 0.16–0.37 percentage points in the medium term. This is mainly due to an increase in spending by oil-importing countries, which exceeds the decline in expenditure by oil exporters.},

The random walk and unbiased efficiency are equally bad forecasters that should not be used as benchmarks for measuring forecasting accuracy. The simulation and econometric results show that when two forecasters are not independent they produce forecasts of similar quality, in which case it is erroneous to use the forward rate as a forecaster and the spot rate as a benchmark. Theoretical and intuitive explanations are presented for why the random walk and unbiased efficiency produce poor-quality forecasts that are almost identical. The failure of unbiased efficiency is explained primarily in terms of the post Keynesian view of the forward exchange rate.},

The empirical results are based on annual time series data for six country groups as well as cross-sectional data covering a large number of countries. The model is initially specified with unobserved components and estimated in a time-varying parametric framework to account for missing variables. Thereafter, the issue of linear versus quadratic specifications is examined. The results are robust with respect to model specification, estimation method, data type and variable definition, showing in general that financialization has a negative impact on growth. Some evidence is also presented to support the notion of the financial Kuznets curve.},

  abstract = {There is a large literature focused on exchange rate forecasting. A common finding is that it is difficult to systematically predict exchange rate movements, consistent with the results of Meese and Rogoff (1983), who showed that it is difficult to beat a random walk forecast. This note heads down the same well-worn path, but assesses the usefulness of the Commitments of Traders (COT) positioning data for understanding and predicting exchange rate movements. COT data has been used extensively in research assessing the impact of speculation in commodity markets, but there has been comparatively little recent research into the usefulness of this data for thinking about foreign exchange market developments. COT data also provides classifications of trading entities that allow the trading behaviour of different groups of traders (such as hedgers and speculators), and their respective market impact, to be examined. This note focuses on the positioning of speculative traders who are thought to express their beliefs of future currency movements through futures positions. The COT data is available at weekly frequency and aggregates holdings of futures in key US markets. The lag between the collection of the COT data and its publication may in fact limit its information content. For example, assuming markets are informationally efficient, new information is expected to be quickly incorporated into spot exchange rates and futures positions at the same time. Therefore, the data cannot provide insight as to whether exchange rates change contemporaneously as futures positions are opened or closed (in real-time). The key question examined in this note is what the information content of COT positioning data is for major currencies, and at what horizon is positioning data best for forecasting exchange rate changes. As has been found by earlier studies, our results suggest that futures positioning data can help with interpretation of historical exchange rate changes, although its use as a predictor of exchange rates is limited. However, higher frequency positioning data, such as hourly or daily data, may in fact have predictive power.},

This paper argues that central banks increasingly rely on unconventional tools in noncrisis times to maintain confidence in an unstable financial system: in rich countries, outright asset purchase programs form the core of monetary policy, and in emerging capitalist economies, the sale and purchase of foreign exchange assets constitute the central mechanism of exchange rate policy. These interventions increasingly target ‘market dysfunction,’ as opposed to (a narrow interpretation of) monetary policy or the level of the exchange rate, suggesting a convergence in central bank operations around maintaining the plumbing of finance. Using two case studies – foreign exchange operations by the Reserve Bank of India and asset purchase programs by the U.S. Federal Reserve – the paper demonstrates a blurring of the boundaries between crisis and noncrisis interventions, and lends evidence to the concept of a de-risking state that guarantees liquidity. The paper concludes with a discussion of how a de-risking state exacerbates inequality, financial vulnerabilities and undermines meaningful action on pressing issues such as climate change.},

The impulse response results suggest unconventional easing had little effect on stock prices as in conventional easing while the responses of interest rates indicate liquidity was provided throughout the world. An unconventional US monetary tightening policy shock could effectively affect the stock prices of the world as is the case with a conventional US monetary tightening shock. Furthermore, the transmission of a US monetary policy shock to stock prices via exchange rates tends to attenuate the decrease in stock prices both in the conventional and unconventional tightening (the exit from a zero rate) phases. On the other hand, the transmission tends to push down stock prices in the conventional, unconventional monetary easing and the unconventional tightening (the shadow rate is negative) phases.}

Second, increased payments to the financial markets may have impeded real investment by decreasing available internal funds, shortening the planning horizons of the firm management and increasing uncertainty.}

  abstract = {Currency internationalisation, often defined by the use of a local currency beyond the national frontier, has been a topic widely discussed in the literature. The recent rise of currencies from emerging market economies in the international market has suggested that some peripheral currencies have become more internationalised. However, their position in the currency hierarchy, which is formed by the US dollar at the top and other central currencies in an intermediate position, has remained the same. Despite the growing participation of emerging currencies in the international market, the literature focuses primarily on the internationalisation of central currencies, with the exception of the Chinese renminbi. Additionally, most empirical studies in this literature focus on a single dimension or analyse a general degree of currency internationalisation. The general objective of this thesis is to investigate the nature and the determinants of the internationalisation of central and peripheral currencies. This thesis focuses on the types of currency internationalisation, which are reflected in the currency hierarchy, and adopts a Post Keynesian perspective to shed light on the subordinate position of peripheral currencies in the International Monetary System. A cluster analysis is applied to evaluate the different types of currency internationalisation, followed by a panel data on the determinants of each of these dimensions. Lastly, this thesis conducts semi-structured interviews to understand the nature of the internationalisation of the Brazilian real, which is an emerging currency that has been more used by non-residents recently. As a general conclusion, this thesis suggests that emerging market currencies are mainly internationalised as a short-term investment currency, which reinforces their subordinate position in the currency hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Efficiently Inefficient describes the key trading strategies used by hedge funds and demystifies the secret world of active investing. Leading financial economist Lasse Heje Pedersen combines the latest research with real-world examples and interviews with top hedge fund managers to show how certain trading strategies make money—and why they sometimes don't. Pedersen views markets as neither perfectly efficient nor completely inefficient. Rather, they are inefficient enough that money managers can be compensated for their costs through the profits of their trading strategies and efficient enough that the profits after costs do not encourage additional active investing. Understanding how to trade in this efficiently inefficient market provides a new, engaging way to learn finance. Pedersen analyzes how the market price of stocks and bonds can differ from the model price, leading to new perspectives on the relationship between trading results and finance theory. He explores several different areas in depth—fundamental tools for investment management, equity strategies, macro strategies, and arbitrage strategies—and he looks at such diverse topics as portfolio choice, risk management, equity valuation, and yield curve logic. The book’s strategies are illuminated further by interviews with leading hedge fund managers: Lee Ainslie, Cliff Asness, Jim Chanos, Ken Griffin, David Harding, John Paulson, Myron Scholes, and George Soros. Efficiently Inefficient effectively demonstrates how financial markets really work. Free problem sets are available online at http://www.lhpedersen.com},

This two-part conjecture was given further emphasis by other writers on this period, notably Einzig (1937).

The analysis is in the spirit of Perron (1990a), who showed that the existence of such a shift in a stationary time series biases the usual tests for a unit root toward nonrejection. The approach is, however, different given that we suppose the date of the change to be unknown. The statistic of interest is then the minimal t statistic over all possible breakpoints in regressions similar to those proposed by Perron (1990a). Other related statistics are also discussed. We derive and tabulate the asymptotic distributions of interest. Most of the emphasis, however, is given to the tabulation of finite-sample critical values using simulation experiments. Particular attention is given to the effect, on the finite-sample critical values, of various procedures to select the appropriate order of the estimated autoregressions. We apply the tests to analyze the issue of purchasing power parity between the United States and the United Kingdom and also between the United States and Finland, whose real exchange rates are characterized by apparent shifts in level when using particular price indexes.}

Individual region-specific vector error-correcting models are estimated in which the domestic variables are related to corresponding foreign variables constructed exclusively to match the international trade pattern of the country under consideration. The individual country models are then linked in a consistent and cohesive manner to generate forecasts for all of the variables in the world economy simultaneously. The global model is estimated for 25 countries grouped into 11 regions using quarterly data over 1979Q1–1999Q1. The degree of regional interdependencies is investigated via generalized impulse responses where the effects of shocks to a given variable in a given country on the rest of the world are provided. The model is then used to investigate the effects of various global risk scenarios on a bank's loan portfolio.},

The main empirical conclusions are: (1) both systematic and non-systematic monetary policy have changed during the last 40 years—in particular, systematic responses of the interest rate to inflation and unemployment exhibit a trend toward a more aggressive behaviour, despite remarkable oscillations; (2) this has had a negligible effect on the rest of the economy. The role played by exogenous non-policy shocks seems more important than interest rate policy in explaining the high inflation and unemployment episodes in recent U.S. economic history.}

  abstract = {There is a global financial cycle in capital flows, asset prices and in credit growth. This cycle co‐moves with the VIX, a measure of uncertainty and risk aversion of the markets. Asset markets in countries with more credit inflows are more sensitive to the global cycle. The global financial cycle is not aligned with countries’ specific macroeconomic conditions. Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system. Whenever capital is freely mobile, the global financial cycle constrains national monetary policies regardless of the exchange rate regime. For the past few decades, international macroeconomics has postulated the “trilemma”: with free capital mobility, independent monetary policies are feasible if and only if exchange rates are floating. The global financial cycle transforms the trilemma into a “dilemma” or an “irreconcilable duo”: independent monetary policies are possible if and only if the capital account is managed. So should policy restrict capital mobility? Gains to international capital flows have proved elusive whether in calibrated models or in the data. Large gross flows disrupt asset markets and financial intermediation, so the costs may be very large. To deal with the global financial cycle and the “dilemma”, we have the following policy options: ( a) targeted capital controls; (b) acting on one of the sources of the financial cycle itself, the monetary policy of the Fed and other main central banks; (c) acting on the transmission channel cyclically by limiting credit growth and leverage during the upturn of the cycle, using national macroprudential policies; (d) acting on the transmission channel structurally by imposing stricter limits on leverage for all financial intermediaries.}

It proposes, instead, an interest rate policy whereby the central bank "parks" the interest rate (real or nominal) according to a specific rule. Three possible parking rules are examined—the Smithin rule, the Kansas City rule, and the Pasinetti fair rate rule. The paper then explores the macroeconomic consequences of a genuine Post Keynesian alternative to new consensus monetary policy along the lines of the fair rate rule.},

In line with this interpretation, we find that the scale of FX intervention responds to the degree of exchange rate misalignment relative to UIP conditions.

Our results show that USD funding plays an important role in the transmission mechanism, especially for French banks which rely to a larger extent on USD funding. We also show that banks adjust their euro and foreign currency lending differently, thus implying that funding sources in different currencies are not perfect substitutes.

Since the global financial crisis in 2008, there has been a shift in the conduct of monetary policy. Much like the behavior of asset holders themselves, who, in times of crisis, sought to trade off lower returns with more stable asset values, monetary policy changed from a de facto policy of stabilizing rentier income to one of preserving asset prices or rentier wealth. I analyze this particularly through the lenses of what happened with quantitative easing (QE) in the US, which coincided with a collapse of real interest rates, while asset prices were stabilized. This can also be seen in the way the banking sector was supported by QE where the market for mortgage-backed securities was sustained even as it actually meant a lower profitability for the overall U.S. banking sector during the QE interventions.},

Thus, this study introduced machining learning approach (feature selection, particle swarm optimization—PSO, and genetic algorithm—GA techniques) to evaluate the relative primacy of the exchange rate for sustainable economic growth in Germany, South Africa, and Slovakia using Rodrik model with time series data from 1990 to 2016. The study reveals that GDP per capita is the most crucial variable for economic growth in Germany and South Africa whereas, in Slovakia, the real exchange rate takes precedence over all other determinants of economic growth. That is, exchange rate takes precedence over other factors as a determinant of economic growth in an economy (Slovakia) with the high rate of trade openness while income per capita is the most important determinant of economic growth in economies (Germany and South Africa) with a relatively lower rate of trade openness. This partly supports Rodrik’s conclusion. We, therefore, recommend that highly opened economies should focus on viable exchange rate policies, such as undervaluation of currency to enhance sustained economic growth. On the other hand, relatively less open economies should focus on policies that improve income per capita rather than exchange rate policies.},

What we find is an interesting evidence that only stock market development has positive effects on growth and that banking development has an unfavorable, if not negative, effect on growth. We examine whether or not these impacts are a product of various financial and economic conditional variables. Our conditional variables consist of financial liberalization, two sets of country development dummies, crises in banking and currency dummies, the creditor protection index as well as the anti-director and corruption indices. Our results clearly show that the conditional variables of financial liberalization, high-income level, and good shareholder protection mitigate the negative impacts of banking development on growth. In contrast, the conditional variables of middle-income level, regional Latin American, Sub-Saharan African and East Asian dummies, banking and currency crises, good creditor protection, and higher corruption strengthen the negative impacts of banking development on growth. Next, the conditional variables of middle-income level, Latin American, Sub-Saharan African, and East Asian dummies strengthen the positive impacts of stock market development on growth, whereas the conditional variables of financial liberalization mitigate the positive impacts of stock market development on growth. Last, we find that the relationship between growth and bank development is better described as a weak inverse U-shape. This inverse U-shape becomes stronger when additional stock market variables are squared. Thus, financial development and growth may, in fact, be in a nonlinear form.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the implications for open economy macroeconomic analysis of the "cambist" approach to the forward exchanges, put forward by Lavoie (2000) and others. It argues that logically the counterpart to the rejection of any domestic natural rate of interest must also be the rejection of the idea that the real exchange rate is primarily determined by nonmonetary factors such as the supposedly immutable barter terms of trade. The real exchange rate is an endogenous monetary variable and is therefore subject in principle to manipulation by public policy. Much depends on the nature and determinants of the currency risk premium, in an environment in which separate monetary systems in different economies continue to exist, and which is characterized by imperfect asset substitutability, whether or not there is also perfect capital mobility.},

Distrust in banks or in conventional currencies is not found to be an important driver of ownership. Intentions to adopt are strongly affected by profit expectations and by beliefs that crypto-assets offer advantages for payments—most adopters or potential adopters hold both beliefs. Perceptions of high volatility or the risk of fraud and online theft dampen the demand for crypto-assets.}

In the second part, the link between accumulation and financialisation is tested econometrically by means of a time series analysis of aggregate business investment for the USA, the UK, France and Germany. Extensive tests of robustness are performed. For the first three countries, evidence supporting the negative effect of financialisation on accumulation is found.}

In contrast, such commodity price comovements were absent in China, which refutes growing commodity demands from emerging economies as the driver.}

The results overwhelmingly support the market efficiency hypothesis.}

The paper estimates the open-economy Bhaduri–Marglin model using the single-equation technique outlined in .

The aim of this paper is to analyse the effect of macroprudential policy on both capital flow volatility and price stability in emerging market economies. The analysis covers the Global Financial Crisis and post-crisis period. The effects of general macroprudential variables including leverage growth and credit growth and specific instruments, namely loan-to-value caps and reserve requirements on capital inflow, capital outflow and price stability have been tested. Propensity score matching techniques have been used to measure the effectiveness of various macroprudential policy measures on capital flow volatility. Major findings indicate monetary policy instruments are effective in pursuing both monetary policy objectives and macroprudential objectives. Short-term capital account volatility is seen to respond to macroprudential policy instruments. Propensity score matching was only successfully implemented for capital volatility. Results show that increased measures for macroprudential policy are effective for capital outflow and, decreased measures for macroprudential policy are effective, to a lesser extent, for capital inflows. Furthermore, meaningful correlation between increased macroprudential measures during periods of tight monetary policy exists only for capital outflows.}

Such a “vision” and “paradigm” will help central banks to become more progressive institutions, namely, more embedded in society.                      Focusing on the case of Ecuador, which I have been investigating for one year, and which provides evidence of progressive policies, I attempt to argue that gender diversity will promote:                                                           The ability to reach new central bank objectives.

Studies of financialization interrogate how an increasingly autonomous realm of global finance has altered the underlying logics of the industrial economy and the inner workings of democratic society. This paper evaluates the insights of more than a decade of scholarship on financialization. Three approaches will be discussed: the emergence of a new regime of accumulation, the ascendency of the shareholder value orientation and the financialization of everyday life. It is argued that a deeper understanding of financialization will lead to a better understanding of organized interests, the politics of the welfare state, and processes of institutional change.}

The inability of the United States to manage the system given the growing imbalances associated to the need of persistent current account deficits to provide liquidity in dollars, and the resulting inflationary pressures on the one hand, and the increasing disproportion of dollars and gold reserves, on the other, would bring about the end of the system. In other words, the Triffin Dilemma was ultimately correct, and the exorbitant privilege came with a high price tag. The limitations of the dominant view about Bretton Woods are discussed and it is argued that the end of Bretton Woods was a political decision that led to the consolidation of dollar hegemony. The limitations of the conventional view are ultimately tied to mainstream economics.},

  abstract = {Central banks’ role in financialization has received increasing attention in recent years. These debates have predominantly revolved around authorities’ ‘benign neglect’ of asset bubbles, their deregulatory policies, and the safety nets they provide for speculative exuberance. Most analyses refer to the dominance of pro-market interests and ideas to explain these actions. The present article moves beyond these accounts by showing how an alignment between techniques of monetary governance and ‘unfettered’ financial markets can explain central banks’ endorsement of increasingly fragile structures of liquidity and their strategic ignorance towards growing amounts of debt. We analyze the processes of abstraction and formalization by which the ‘programmes’ and ‘technologies’ of monetary governance have been made compatible with the texture of contemporary finance; and we show how central banks’ attempts to make markets more amenable to their methods of policy implementation shaped new conduits for financial growth. As empirical cases, we discuss the Federal Reserve’s experiments with different policy frameworks in the 1980s and the Bank of England’s twisted path to inflation targeting from 1979 to 1997. These cases allow us to demonstrate that the infrastructural power of contemporary central banking is predicated on the same institutional foundations that have made financialization possible.},

It has been found that large speculator sentiment forecasts price continuations. In contrast, large hedger sentiment predicts price reversals. Small trader sentiment hardly forecasts future market movements. An investigation was performed into various sentiment-based timing strategies, and it was found that the combination of extreme large trader sentiments provides the strongest timing signal. These results are generally consistent with the hedging-pressure theory, suggesting that hedgers pay risk premiums to transfer nonmarketable risks in futures markets. Moreover, it does not appear that large speculators in the futures markets possess any superior forecasting ability. © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark 21:929–952, 2001},

  abstract = {SUMMARY Currency competition provided a stable monetary standard in those Swiss cantons that deregulated their financial systems after liberal revolutions in the 1830s and 40s. The Swiss currency issuers’ concern with purchasing power stability suggests that each of them faced a real demand for notes that was sensitive to expected changes in the purchasing power of those notes. Given purchasing power stability, the circulation of a currency depended on the quality of the financial services of its issuer. Issuing and keeping notes in circulation was costly. The share of notes in the balance sheets of their issuers was therefore small except in periods when interest rates on other debt instruments were high. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Freie Konkurrenz zwischen Währungen garantierte monetäre Stabilität in jenen Schweizer Kantonen, die nach liberalen Revolutionen zwischen 1830 und 1850 ihr Währungssystem reformierten. Die Beachtung, die die schweizerischen Notenprodu-zenten der Kaufkraftstabilität schenkten, legt nahe, dass die reale Banknotennach-frage von der erwarteten Kaufkraftveränderung abhing. Bei gegebener Kaufkraft ist die Zirkulation einer Währung durch die Qualität der finanziellen Dienstleistungen ihres Anbieters bestimmt. Die Ausgabe von Banknoten verursacht Kosten, und es ist teuer, sie im Verkehr zu halten. Daher war der Anteil von Banknoten in der Bilanz ihrer Anbieter gering, ausser in Zeiten, in denen der Zins auf anderen Finanzierungs-instrumenten hoch war. RÉSUMÉ La concurrence monétaire libre eut comme résultat une stabilityé monétaire pour les cantons suisses qui avaient réformé leurs systèmes monétaires après les révolutions libérales des années 1830 et 1840. L'importance que les émetteurs monétaires suisses attribuaient à la stabilityé du pouvoir d'achat suggère que la demande pour les billets de banque dépendait de la variation escomptée du pouvoir d'achat. Pour un certain pouvoir d'achat, la circulation monétaire est déterminée par la qualityé des services financiers de l'émetteur. L'émission des billets de banque et leur maintien en circulation est une affaire cou̧teuse. Dans le bilan des émetteurs, la contribution des billets de banque était done insignifiante, sauf dans les périodes où d'autres instruments de dette étaient sujets à des intérȩts éleves.}

  abstract = {This paper explores the distributional effects of monetary policy in the context of a small open economy. Emerging markets are structurally different from developed economies. They are generally associated with greater financial frictions, underdeveloped financial markets, as well as both a high average level of dollarized assets and unequal access to them, among others. Thus, distributional effects of monetary policy in emerging economies require additional specifications. In particular, I show that wealthy households (represented by the top 10\% of the income distribution), who are more able to save in foreign currencies, gain in purchasing power of their incomes by hedging against domestic inflation. At the same time, the poor households (represented by the bottom fifty percent of the income distribution) retain a larger share of liquid assets denominated in domestic currency, thus experiencing a greater burden of local currency inflation. I also show that contractionary monetary policy is associated with periods of higher income inequality in emerging markets that is likely to exacerbate the damaging impact of inflation on the bottom groups of the income distribution.}
